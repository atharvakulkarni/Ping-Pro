# Ping-Pro
A very little, fun and intuitive game, Built on a few lines of HTML, CSS and JS. With just 2 libraries. Its a good beginner project to learn about making small web games using your HTML, CSS and JS knowledge. You can also enjoy these games on your smartphones as they also have major browsers.
