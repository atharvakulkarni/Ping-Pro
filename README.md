A very little, fun and intuitive game, you can enjoy. Built on HTML, CSS and JS. A few codes and just 2 JS libraries- Hand.js and jQuery. Its a good beginner project to learn about making small web games using your HTML, CSS and JS knowledge. You can also enjoy these games on your smartphones as they also have major browsers.
